# eBike - Part 3 - Final Solution

The final implementation of the project assesses your ability to **1)** apply what you have learned in the course, **2)** extend your knowledge and skills through self-directed research, and **3)** integrate and apply that learning to a particular set of business requirements (your *scenario*).

## Evaluation

> This evaluation assumes a minimal requirement that the supplied solution compiles in the instructor's environment.

The assessment consists of two parts:

- [**Code Quality** ](#code-quality)
  - Measured in individual marks ranging from **0 to 25** inclusive (no fractional portions).
  - This is an *additive* component of the assessment that looks at the quality of your code in terms of **correctness**, **maintainability**, and **efficiency**. It evaluates everything from **usability design** to **code implementation details** in your project.
- [**Implementation Completeness**](#implementation-completeness)
  - Measured in 5-mark increments ranging from **0 to 25** inclusive.
  - This is a *subtractive* component of the assessment that examines how much of the overall requirements have been attempted.

The mark is determined by taking the marks awarded for code-quality and subtracting the deductions for incomplete work: `FinalMark = CodeQuality - Completeness`

### Examples

> *Sally's subsystem demonstrated a very high level of quality (between **Excellent** and **Proficient**) and for **Code Quality** she was awarded 23/25. But her system was only about 80% completed, so 5/25 is deducted from her mark leaving her with a final mark of **`18`**/25.*

> *Bob's subsystem demonstrated an **Acceptable** level of quality and was awarded 15/25 for **Code Quality**. The complete system was submitted and no deductions were applied, leaving him with a final mark of **`15`**/25.*

> *Pat put a lot of hard work into the project and achieved a **Code Quality** mark of 25/25. However, due to time constraints and other course work, only 40% of the requirements were addressed. An **Implementation Completeness** deduction of 15/25 was applied, resulting in a final mark of **`10`**/25 for the final deliverable.*

> *Ruby demonstrated a code quality that was somewhat above acceptable and was awarded 18/25. Her portion of the project was about 80% complete, giving a deduction of 5/25. Her final mark was **`13`**/25.*

> *Phil was awarded 24/25 for his near-excellent work. His portion of the project was complete, resulting in a final mark of **`24`**/25.*

## Rubrics

### Code Quality

| Awarded | Description                                                    |
| :-----: | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   25    | **Excellent** (requirement is fully met)                      |
|   20    | **Proficient** (requirement is adequately met, minor concerns)      |
|   15    | **Acceptable** (requirement is partially met, minor concerns)    |
|   10    | **Sub-Par** (requirement is partially met, significant concerns) |
|    5    | **Limited** (requirement is poorly met, major concerns)          |
|    0    | **Unacceptable** (requirement not met, )   |

### Implementation Completeness

| Deducted | Description   |
| :------: | ------------- |
|    25    | **0%** Complete   |
|    20    | **20%** Complete  |
|    15    | **40%** Complete  |
|    10    | **60%** Complete  |
|    5     | **80%** Complete  |
|    0     | **100%** Complete |
